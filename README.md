## Analysis of Social Chatter vs Market Results, Post IPO
---
### Executive Summary / Project Description
Prior to filing an initial public offering(IPO), a privately held company's value is largely a guess.  While the company needs to meet IPO criteria, by providing insight into income, assets, revenue growth, etc. Pre-IPO companies don't have any feedback or demonstrated buyer history to measure the immediate purchase of its shares at a particular price.   

This analysis measures social queues to market movements in an attempt to find a correlation. Our analysis reviews social chatter for 90 days from the IPO launch to see if it could be used as a mechanism to determining future stock fluctuations and/or trading volume. The overall motivation for this project was the general excitement in the uptick of IPOâ€™s and the curiosity of finding a way to validate or predict market prices and volumes.
